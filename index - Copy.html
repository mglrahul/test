                <h2>Web of Sites is a group of websites created by <strong>Katharine Wall</strong> in Vancouver, Canada.</h2>
                <p>The Web of Sites portfolio began in 2005 when I first created Adopted.com to help Adoptees locate their birth parents. My group of sites has since grown to include a dating site for people with Lyme disease, an affiliate site aggregating Wrap Dresses from all over the world, and an exciting and top secret new app still under development!</p>

                    <p>For over 10 years now Adopted.com has been a leading Adoption Reunion website, bringing together adoptees and birth parents all over the world.  With a special algorithm designed to help people in all kinds of adoption situations, Adopted.com offers an incredible tool for people to locate their family that can't be found anywhere else.</p>

                    <p>With the recent discovery that Lyme Disease is spread as an STD, there rose an immediate need for a site for people with Lyme to network for information and companionship.  I responded to this need by creating LymeLife.com, which has the destinction of being the only dating site in the world dedicated to those with Lyme.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by the trend toward more boutique-style shopping sites, WrapDress.com caters to a very specific audience.  Finding a good selection of the ever popular wrap style dresses used to take a lot of searching - until I created WrapDress.com, using a special combination of new technologies to bring together the most wrap dresses found anywhere, with a high level of detail.  This new concept is currently being developed for more types of merchandise.</p>
